## Books

### The Bitcoin Standard - Saifedean Ammous

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)

This is the consensus choice for best book to fully understand Bitcoin and the macro-economic + "history of finance" context for the need for Bitcoin. It is highly recommended by anyone in the Bitcoin thought leaders community (full disclosure, I haven't read this one, but read many articles and books that followed)

_"This book blew my mind; it is a work of genius. It put together the technical, economic, motivational and related issues around Bitcoin better than anything I've seen. The best compliment I can give this book is that I read it and I decided to buy $425m of bitcoin. It was the most impactful on our way of thinking in Microstrategy and it made us want to invert our balance sheet to base it on a bitcoin standard."_
―Michael Saylor, cofounder, chairman, and CEO of Microstrategy

### Broken Money - Lyn Alden

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Money-Financial-System-Failing-ebook/dp/B0CGNVNXK2/ref=sr_1_1)

I read this book end-to-end and learned ton from it. It's very similar to "The Bitcoin Standard" above, but more updated (published in mid-2022). The book reviews the full history of money, finance and banks, and then moves on to a full coverage of Bitcoin on all its aspects and challenges as well. I give this book 5 stars and highly recommend it.

### Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall - Zeke Faux 
[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering/dp/0593443810) 

This book actually covers the "dark side" of crypto. Mostly NFT's and shit-coins. It almost doesn't talk about Bitcoin. Still interesting and fun reading for learning about why the other stuff on crypto-land are so dangerous.

### 2006 - Why the Global Financial System is About to Collapse

In this amazing 2006 article written by anonymous economist who clearly understands super super well how monetary systems work. The key argument in this article is the transition of "savings" from fiat currencies, mainly the US dollar into gold and silver, and the eventual collapse or dramatic loss of value of the US dollar, while "savings" be transitioned into gold (or any other electronic money like gold). Keep in mind, it was written 3 years before Bitcoin was invented and the gold was trading around $600 an ounce. 

"The dollar's most obvious weapon is just that gold, although it is to some extent money, is not currency. No one accepts gold in exchange for goods and services. The digital gold currencies could change this, but if they do it will be far in the future."

### Michael Saylor: Bitcoin, Inflation, and the Future of Money | Lex Fridman Podcast #276
