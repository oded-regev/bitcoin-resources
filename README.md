## Books

### The Bitcoin Standard - Saifedean Ammous

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)

This is the consensus choice for best book to fully understand Bitcoin and the macro-economic + "history of finance" context for the need for Bitcoin. It is highly recommended by anyone in the Bitcoin thought leaders community (full disclosure, I haven't read this one, but read many articles and books that followed)

_"This book blew my mind; it is a work of genius. It put together the technical, economic, motivational and related issues around Bitcoin better than anything I've seen. The best compliment I can give this book is that I read it and I decided to buy $425m of bitcoin. It was the most impactful on our way of thinking in Microstrategy and it made us want to invert our balance sheet to base it on a bitcoin standard."_
â€•Michael Saylor, cofounder, chairman, and CEO of Microstrategy

### Broken Money - Lyn Alden

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Money-Financial-System-Failing-ebook/dp/B0CGNVNXK2/ref=sr_1_1)

I read this book end-to-end and learned ton from it. It's very similar to "The Bitcoin Standard" above, but more updated (published in mid-2022). The book reviews the full history of money, finance and banks, and then moves on to a full coverage of Bitcoin on all its aspects and challenges as well. I give this book 5 stars and highly recommend it.

### Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall - Zeke Faux 
[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering/dp/0593443810) 

This book actually covers the "dark side" of crypto. Mostly NFT's and shit-coins. It almost doesn't talk about Bitcoin. Still interesting and fun reading for learning about why the other stuff on crypto-land are so dangerous.
